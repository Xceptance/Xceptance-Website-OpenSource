# Couple of important things about localization.
#
# * This is the localization plugin
#   https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin/
# * No tabs in yaml de/en file, spaces make the hierarchy
# * Use speaking names for keys and feel free to have hierarchies where
#   appropriate
# * For missing keys, you will see exceptions during compile until
#   the project released again with my pull request incorporated
# * Keep en and de in sync!
# * Global is for everything that is repeated everywhere such as buttons or
#   certain link texts
# * {% t page.area.name %} that is the text for an html page
#   to refer to something here like that in yaml.

    testautomation:
        headline: Test Automation
        lead: "Familiar with Selenium? You will love functional testing with XLT! We extended the concept with test data management, modules, variables, and macro functionality."
        text1: Choose your preferred way of writing tests. You can utilize our Script Developer UI or code all your tests in Java using the familiar WebDriver syntax. Of course, XLT also works perfectly with all <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">WebDrivers</a>, with <a href="http://www.browserstack.com/">BrowserStack</a>, and <a href="https://saucelabs.com/">Sauce Labs</a>.
        features:
            headline: What XLT Brings to the Table
            details: "<li><strong>Script Developer</strong> as a small but flexible IDE that lets you script right in Firefox</li>
                    <li><strong>Modules</strong> to achieve great reusability</li>
                    <li><strong>Parameters</strong> to pass data to modules</li>

                    <li><strong>Macros</strong> to generate data dynamically</li>
                    <li><strong>Test documentation</strong> is maintained together with the scripts</li>
                    <li>An <strong>open file format</strong> to avoid exporting to Java if not necessary</li>
                    <li><strong>Test data sets</strong> to run</li>
                    <li><strong>No-programming configuration</strong> of WebDrivers to simplify development</li>"
        text2: XLT is always free for functional testing. And that includes all updates.

    loadtesting:
        headline: Load Testing
        lead: Performance is key for web applications, so you need a tool that realistically tests performance. You want to compare test runs, have instant, meaningful reports and access to raw data for even more analysis? That is XLT!
        text1: "<p>
                XLT offers flexible and realistic testing of a web application's performance under load. Several different ways of composing tests allow you to choose the best way to complete a given task. 'Record &amp; Replay' mainly suits simple scenarios and basic URLs. But the power comes with Java as the scripting language, because it lets you write realistic, flexible, and data-independent scenarios.
               </p>

                <p>
                    You can deploy XLT to any number of machines, with any number of test scenarios, and any number of load profile setups. The rich reports with the opportunity to time-slice them and to group requests will highlight problems in an instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result browser provides instant feedback on the test scenario while designing it. When load testing, the result browser will give you the information you need to diagnose a problem in detail.
                </p>"

        features:
            headline: Features and Functionality in a Nutshell
            details: <li><strong>Realistic load profiles</strong>, like arrival rate and user rate. Combinable with ramp-up time and initial delays</li>
                    <li><strong>Different test approaches</strong>, such as URL-based or DOM-based</li>
                    <li><strong>Java</strong> as scripting language, if scripting is needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive reports</strong> out of the box. These also let you compare test runs and report trends. Configurable in content and layout</li>
                    <li><strong>Realtime reporting</strong> using Graphite and Grafana</li>
                    <li><strong>As many</strong> scenarios, users, and load test machines <strong>as you like</strong></li>
                    <li>Support for <strong>SLA</strong> definitions</li>
                    <li><strong>Test offline</strong>. Start the test and decouple the controller.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open data formats</strong> for report and result data</li>
                    <li><strong>Result browser</strong> shows detailed test behavior during design time and supports error diagnosis during test time</li>
                    <li><strong>On-failure reporting</strong> captures all available data for a post-mortem analysis.</li>
                    <li>Get <strong>full reports</strong> at any time during test execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>External data</strong> can be captured and added to the reports.</li>

Well, XLT lets you do so. No limits. It works for arrival rate-based tests as well as for user-based tests.
