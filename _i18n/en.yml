# Couple of important things about localization.
#
# * This is the localization plugin
#   https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin/
# * No tabs in yaml de/en file, spaces make the hierarchy
# * Use speaking names for keys and feel free to have hierarchies where
#   appropriate
# * For missing keys, you will see exceptions during compile until
#   the project released again with my pull request incorporated
# * Keep en and de in sync!
# * Global is for everything that is repeated everywhere such as buttons or
#   certain link texts
# * {% t page.area.name %} that is the text for an html page
#   to refer to something here like that in yaml.

        text1: "<p>
                XLT offers flexible and realistic testing of a web application's performance under load. Several different ways of composing tests allow you to choose the best way to complete a given task. 'Record &amp; Replay' mainly suits simple scenarios and basic URLs. But the power comes with Java as the scripting language, because it lets you write realistic, flexible, and data-independent scenarios. 
               </p>  

                <p>
                    You can deploy XLT to any number of machines, with any number of test scenarios, and any number of load profile setups. The rich reports with the opportunity to time-slice them and to group requests will highlight problems in an instant.

                    headline: Reports
                    text: <p>All reports can be adjusted in content and layout, because we deliver the CSS and the render templates as part of XLT. So if you need custom layouts of reports, you are covered. You want to have your own summary of data? Not a problem. You want to reduce the data? Fine as well.</p>

                data:
                    headline: Custom and External Data
                    text: "<p>
                            During a load test, XLT logs a large amount of data relevant to the test run. Nevertheless, sometimes it comes in handy to log additional information about the system under test. For this purpose, XLT provides custom values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The XLT report generator lets you include external data files in the report. This can be used if it’s impossible to directly access the external data source during the load test runtime.    
                        </p>"

                java:
                    headline: Use Java
                    text: <p>If there is anything that is not part of XLT, you can use Java to make it happen. Of course there are limits, because you can influence the measurements or limit the scaling, but with that in mind, a lot of things are possible.</p>
                
                        
        automation:
            headline: Made for Automation
            lead: Java as script language, open data formats, command lines, JUnit test principle, WebDriver support, and much more.
            details:
                lead: XLT is made to be integrated into all kinds of automation processes. No matter if it‘s just a shell script or a full build process.
                text: <p>We built XLT in a way that perfectly gets along with your preferred IDE, the command line, build processes, or just with a little bit of shell scripting. Engineers need things to work smoothly and quickly. We have that in mind.</p>
            
        profiles:
            headline: Load Profiles
            lead: Arrival rate or steady user rate, ramp-ups, and flexible profiles over the course of a test run. Realistic or predictable, your choice.
            details:
                lead: XLT supports a very flexible setup of load profiles ranging from steady user rates to arrival rates. Compose long-running test setups to reflect what happens during a day, absolutely freely configurable.
                text: "<h3>Load Profile Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Arrival rate model</strong> for realistic simulations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steady user rate</strong> for predictable measurements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ramp-up</strong> for gradually increasing traffic.</li>

                <p>
                    Do you need to have a test where, after a slow ramp-up of low traffic, the load jumps within a minute to peak traffic, stays on that level for 10 minutes to then come back in waves? Well, XLT lets you do so. No limits. It works for arrival rate-based tests as well as for user-based tests.

            headline: User Scenarios
            lead: Unlimited number of user scenarios that can be part of a test. Each scenario can have a different configuration or load profile.
            details:
                lead: Reality is versatile and your test should reflect that. You can set up as many different scenarios as you need and run them together.
                text: <p>Each scenario can be everything from a single pageview to a long-running call center operation. You can give each scenario an individual configuration that includes the load profile. The start of scenarios can be delayed in relation to other scenarios if needed.</p>

            headline: See Everything
            lead: The result browser precisely shows you what happens in a scenario. It visualizes any failure situation for a post-mortem analysis as well.

                                    Imagine a long-running test and you see three errors during the execution but thousands of transactions went just fine. XLT provides deep insights into the moments when the 
                                    application misbehaves.
                                </p>

                                    When errors occur during load testing, the last moments of the transaction are saved, including the downloaded data and all technical details. You can thus see what was sent and received. When you use the request-ID feature of XLT, you even get a unique ID you can match against your server logs.

                lead: A test is only as good as its verifications. XLT supports and encourages as much validation as possible to really make sure that the pages loaded match the expectations.
                text: <p>You can use the full syntax of assertions known from JUnit and Selenium. If you like Hamcrest, include it, XLT gives you that flexibility. XLT also provides access to all sub-requests of a page, so you can run even more detailed validations.
                    The XLT Action API allows you to include validations before and after each activity.</p>
