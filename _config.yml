### Disabled for now. Default is nice.
# permalink: :categories/:year-:month-:day-:title.html

# The navigation to include, everything here is meant to be
# a key to find the correct page. The name and link titles are
# taken from every page itself as well as the relation to its parent.

# Each name has to be unique and the page has to have the same name 
# Check the area in -- and the name attribute for that.
# Same name, same page. URLs here are also the default built urls. 
# Custom works different.
